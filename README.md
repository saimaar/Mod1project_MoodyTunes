## Process

### Setup
1. Create Gemfile + run `bundle`
2. Create migrations: run `rake db:create_migration` and add the syntax you need (e.g. NAME=create_users)
3. Migrate: run `rake db: migrate`
* **REMEMBER** never ever ever change anything in schema.
4. Go to .bin/run.rb and change the name of the app on line 3
5. Go to ./app/models and change the names of the files (e.g. User.rb <- singular) and the class names inside
6. Set up associations in classes (belongs_to / has_many / has_many through:)
7. Create seed data + run `rake db: seed`
* remember: seeding does not give you any output so no news on your console == good news
8. Check if you've seeded correctly: run `rake c` and check what's the last instance of any of your class
9. Go to ./app/yourAppName.rb and change that file's name and whatever is inside (the class name should correspond to what you wrote in .bin/run.rb on line 3)
